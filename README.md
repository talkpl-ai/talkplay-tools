An LLM-powered music recommendation system that uses tool calling to orchestrate a unified retrieval â†’ reranking pipeline over SQL, BM25, embeddings (text/audio/image/CF), and semantic IDs.

## Features

- **Agentic pipeline**: LLM plans tool calls, executes retrieval, and generates a grounded response.
- **Multi-tool retrieval**: SQL filtering, BM25 lexical search, text/audio/image/CF embeddings, semantic-ID matching.
- **Personalization**: Warm/cold-start aware strategies with user-item similarity when applicable.
- **Repro-friendly**: Lightweight test indices for quick demos; cache-first design for tools and models.

## Requirements / Setup

- Python 3.11
- Linux, macOS, or WSL; GPU recommended for embedding/LLM models (CPU works but slower)

```bash
python -m pip install uv
uv venv .venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv add torch torchvision torchaudio
uv pip install laion_clap
uv pip install -e .
```

## Fetch Tool Environments

Prebuilt demo indices are expected under `./cache`. You can download a prepared bundle and extract it:

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/talkpl-ai/TalkPlayTools-Env/resolve/main/tool_env.tar.gz
tar -xzvf tool_env.tar.gz -C ./cache
```

Expected subdirectories (after extraction):

- `cache/metadata` (test metadata files)
- `cache/bm25` (BM25 indices and `track_index.json`)
- `cache/encoder` (vector DB for embeddings)
- `cache/semantic_id` (RVQ indices per modality)
- `cache/sql` (SQLite DB for tracks)

## Quick Start

Run an example query with the provided test data (cold-start user case). This demo uses only **6,744 tracks** from the test split of [TalkPlayData-2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/talkpl-ai/TalkPlayData-2). Due to licensing constraints, the system returns Spotify links instead of direct audio files.

```bash
python run.py --user_query "I'm looking for calm and slow tempo piano music."
```

Example output:

```bash

ðŸ¤– Assistant Response:
Iâ€™ve found a perfect match for your request!
**"Lieder ohne Worte (Songs without Words), Book 2, Op. 30: No. 7 in E-flat major"**
by **Felix Mendelssohn**, performed by **PÃ©ter Nagy**.
This classical piano piece features a **slow tempo (65.79 BPM)**, **mellow melodies**,
and a **romantic, emotional tone** that exudes calm and introspection.

The trackâ€™s **F# major key** and **instrumental, melancholic style**
make it ideal for a relaxed, reflective mood. Itâ€™s a beautifully
crafted piece that aligns perfectly with your request for calm and slow piano music.

Would you like to explore similar tracks, or need recommendations for different moods?
Iâ€™m here to help! ðŸŽ¹

## Demo App
We've implemented an interactive Gradio web interface for multi-turn conversations with the TalkPlay agent. Note that multi-turn conversation capabilities will be updated in future releases.

To launch the demo interface:
```
python app.py
```

### Configuration

- Default LLM: Qwen3-4B (you can customize in `tpa/agents/__init__.py` or via flags if you extend `run.py`).
- Tools and models read from `./cache` by default; set a different path by changing the constructor args when building the agent.
